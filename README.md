As a part of our **Artificial Intelligence course project**, I, along with my university mates **Ayesha Ehtisham** and **Farheen Arshad**, developed this AI-Powered Health Assistant.  

**AI Health System** is built with **Python, Flask API, and PostgreSQL** and provides three core features:  

1. **Health Chatbot** – Trained on a custom dataset, it predicts possible diseases from symptoms and provides descriptions, medications, and preventions.  
2. **Report Analyzer** – Reads lab reports (e.g., CBC), identifies whether values are normal, low, or high, and generates a summary.  
3. **Nutrition Chatbot** – Acts as a virtual dietitian, suggesting diet plans and exercise routines for a healthier lifestyle.  

The system also supports **speech-to-text & text-to-speech**, and includes a patient management system where new patients register with details (name, age, contact, allergies) while returning patients log in using their contact number.
